# E-commerce Performance 2021 Dashboard

## Project Objective
This comprehensive analysis was developed using Microsoft Power BI to examine and visualize the overall e-commerce performance throughout the year 2021. The primary objective is to gain deep insights into customer behavior patterns, identify emerging sales trends over time, understand payment method preferences, and evaluate the revenue contributions of different product categories. By leveraging the powerful data visualization and interactive dashboard capabilities of Power BI, this project aims to transform raw transactional data into actionable intelligence. The ultimate goal is to empower stakeholders with data-driven decision-making tools that can help optimize marketing strategies, enhance the customer experience, improve operational efficiency, and drive increased sales and customer satisfaction in a highly competitive online marketplace.

## Key Insights
December was the highest revenue month, generating 58 million in sales, largely due to seasonal demand. The most commonly used payment method was Cash on Delivery (COD), accounting for 30.28% of all orders. The top-selling category was Mobiles & Tablets, which brought in 130 million in revenue. Customer age demographics were fairly evenly distributed, with the 25 to 34 age group showing a slight lead. The overall sales trend showed noticeable fluctuations, with strong performance in December and dips in May and October.

## Final Conclusion
To maximize performance, the business should focus seasonal promotions and inventory planning around December, taking advantage of the holiday-driven sales surge. Encouraging digital payment adoption is essential to reduce dependency on cash on delivery (COD), which can introduce operational inefficiencies. Additionally, efforts should be concentrated on top-performing categories like Mobiles & Tablets and Appliances, which consistently generate the highest revenue. Lastly, maintaining segmented marketing strategies for key demographics, particularly the 25 to 44 age group, will help ensure more targeted and effective customer engagement.
