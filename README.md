## Key Insights
December was the highest revenue month, generating 58 million in sales, largely due to seasonal demand. The most commonly used payment method was Cash on Delivery (COD), accounting for 30.28% of all orders. The top-selling category was Mobiles & Tablets, which brought in 130 million in revenue. Customer age demographics were fairly evenly distributed, with the 25 to 34 age group showing a slight lead. The overall sales trend showed noticeable fluctuations, with strong performance in December and dips in May and October.

## Final Conclusion
To maximize performance, the business should focus seasonal promotions and inventory planning around December, taking advantage of the holiday-driven sales surge. Encouraging digital payment adoption is essential to reduce dependency on cash on delivery (COD), which can introduce operational inefficiencies. Additionally, efforts should be concentrated on top-performing categories like Mobiles & Tablets and Appliances, which consistently generate the highest revenue. Lastly, maintaining segmented marketing strategies for key demographics, particularly the 25 to 44 age group, will help ensure more targeted and effective customer engagement.
